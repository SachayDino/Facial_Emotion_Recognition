# Facial_Emotion_Recognition
Facial emotion recognition is a very basic project in machine learning. It is ver very helpful for beginners to learn from here. I have did it as simple as it can be. I have added description of all the code lines I used. I used most of libraries of machine learning and I have used a large data set. One can understand the code very easily.
